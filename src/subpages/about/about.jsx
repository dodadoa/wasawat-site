                I am also currently exploring the low-level programming, data
                engineering, cloud native infrastructure (CNCF stuffs), and
                Blockchain technologies. Sometimes, I live-coding with friends
                using Veda(GLSL) for Algorave. Sometimes, I collaborate with
                artists for art exhibition.
