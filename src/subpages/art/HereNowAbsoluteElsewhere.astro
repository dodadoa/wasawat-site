    This project uses the three-body problem as a metaphor to generate speculative fiction about global relationships. Each celestial body represents a country, and their distances reflect the state of diplomacy — when the bodies move too close, it suggests conflict; when they move apart, it represents stability or peace.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    An algorithm calculates the distances between the three bodies and interprets them as indicators of current geopolitical tension. This data is sent as a prompt to a large language model (such as GPT-4 or Grok), which generates a short speculative fiction about a possible future based on the current state.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    The generated text is then used as input for StreamDiffusion, which creates a visual scene displayed on the top of the screen. The bottom section prints or embosses the generated story and image, archiving each event as a record of "machine-written history."
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    Each new event adds to the archive and becomes part of the next prompt, allowing the system to remember previous narratives and build a continuous, evolving story about the future.

    A flower arrangement accompanies the installation, acting as a living decoration that grows or withers by the end of the exhibition. Painted in metallic tones, the flowers appear futuristic but lifeless — reflecting smaller nations that drift around the larger powers, present yet with little influence on the global scale.
