    I start by scratching sound into the microphone and then manipulating it with code (using TidalCycles). Layer by layer, more sounds are scratched, combined, and transformed, all unfolding improvisationally on the fly.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    Semi-serious in spirit, the piece starts with a blank editor and gradually grows into a full audiovisual performance. It plays with the idea of "from scratch"—both beginning from nothing and the literal act of scratching to create sound.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    In this layered wordplay, "from scratch" becomes less a rule and more a way of noticing how improvisation, sound, and code take shape in real time. As gestures, patterns, and textures build up, the piece shows how things can drift into place on their own—how meaning appears unexpectedly, how small actions grow into structure, and how the performance slowly finds its own direction simply through the act of making.
